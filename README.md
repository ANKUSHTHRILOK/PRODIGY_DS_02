The code starts well by stating the focus on EDA of the Titanic dataset.
Libraries and Tools:

It mentions using Python with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
Data Exploration Steps:

Details the steps performed, including:
Importing libraries
Using head(), tail(), and shape to get a basic understanding of the data (number of rows, columns, etc.)
Calculating survival counts using len()
Handling missing values in the Age column (important step)
Data Visualization:
Mentions creating visualizations using:
Histogram (plt.hist()) for age distribution
Countplots (sns.countplot()) for passenger distribution by sex and Pclass
Potential Improvements:

Specificity: Consider replacing "respective subsets" with "survivors" and "non-survivors" for clarity.
Additional Insights: The code mentions creating visualizations but doesn't discuss the insights gained from them. "The histogram showed a skew towards younger passengers, and the countplots revealed a higher proportion of males on board".
Further Exploration: Briefly mentioned other EDA techniques used (e.g., checking for correlations, analyzing categorical variables).
